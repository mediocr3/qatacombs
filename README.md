# Dungeons and Doorknobs: the Qrusty Qatacomb Quest
everyone knows that all video games must include:
* levels
* a frog
* lots of doors

to be considered "good" or at least "passable". well luckily enough, this project contains all elements of the "video-food-pyramid", as scholars call it. and someday this game might even have other things in it too.

# To Do
✔ means done, ~✔ means sorta done

next update/couple updates:
* a proper death screen which displays how you died ~✔
* starvation ✔
* fixing the bug where you sometimes get stuck in walls when you go through doors
* making the character portrait look better
* smelling food when it's near you

near future:
* sound system with ambience, plenty audio cues about what's around you. ideally the game should be completely playable blind, but it will probably never get to that point.
* saving your statistics: number of games played, longest/shortest run, number of wins
* wizard enemy

when i get around to it
* animations
* secret, third enemy
* an end to the game!

possible additions:
* possibly switching the game's sprites to a higher resolution, because 20x20 doesn't look very good and makes a lot of people squint when playing. this might require a scrolling camera to fit on screen with the side panels if i go too high res. either way this will break a lot of things and be very time consuming.
* an even more secret, fourth enemy
* another item (sword? shield?) it might overcomplicate the game though and make it stray away from the established game loop of running away from danger and exploring caves
* more interesting level generation. this would basically turn it into a whole different game, and would probably only be possible with a scrolling camera. might just save it for a possible sequel.
